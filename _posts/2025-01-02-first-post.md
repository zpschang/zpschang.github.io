The plan for this blog is to summarize my learned knowledge, ideas and future expectations about Artificial Intelligence. 

## Paper Summary

I will summarize the important technical advancements, and summarize the important research areas of AI. 

The following aspects will be covered:
- Advancements in Large Language Models, Multi-modal Language Model and LLM Agents;
- Advancements in Embodied AI, World Models and simulators; 
- Advancements in In-Context Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 

## Futures of AI

I will look ahead as far as possible for future advancements in AI, although a lot of technical advancements cannot be accurately foreseen. I will share my thoughts on the possible future of AI in the next a few years, which includes the future directions I feel interested and some prelinminary ideas. 

Some potential areas and topics include:
- Scaling Law and its future; 
- Physical Intelligence; 
- The Possibility for a General In-context Learning Algorithm; 
- Discussion on AGI, how far are we from AGI, and how AGI impacts humanity. 

## Other Stuffs

I also hope to share other topics that are not related to AI if they are valuable.

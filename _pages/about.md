<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

## Short Bio

I'm a researcher at Microsoft Research Asia, currently leading the project of RL for autonomous game agent at Microsoft Research Asia in collaboration with XBox team. My current research interests include reinforcement learning, foundation models for embodied AI, and generation of high-quality embodied AI dataset. Please [email me](mailto:pushizhang@microsoft.com) if you are looking for internship position.

We must perceive in order to move, but we must also move in order to perceive.

    We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.
